      "task": "Two spheres are positioned on a ground surface for reference and their heights are at z = 0. The spheres are positioned in close proximity to an incline plane whose maximum height is in the positive z direction, BUT ARE NOT DIRECTLY ON THE INCLINE PLANE! Determine which sphere is hollow based on their rolling behavior.",

  "expected_behavior": "The LLM changes the positions of the centers of the spheres to roll down the ramp and records which object went down the fastest",

  "reasoning": "The hollow sphere rolls down slower due to its greater moment of inertia, which would be object 2",
