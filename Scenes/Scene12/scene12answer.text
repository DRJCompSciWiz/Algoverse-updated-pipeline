The mass undergoes oscillatory motion based on the equation x(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ), where ω = sqrt(k/m). External force modifies amplitude and frequency.
    "testing_method": "Apply varying forces to the mass and observe how the oscillations change over time.",
    "expected_behavior": "The mass should oscillate with a frequency and amplitude determined by the spring constant and damping coefficient.",
