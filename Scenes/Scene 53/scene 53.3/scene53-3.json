    "answer": "The block on the steeper incline accelerates faster because the gravitational force component acting parallel to the incline is larger.",
    "expected_behavior": "LLM compares the time taken for each block to slide down the incline and determines which one reaches the bottom faster.",
    "reasoning": "Acceleration on an incline is calculated as a = g * sin(θ); higher θ leads to greater acceleration.",
