      "task": "Determine whether the simulator correctly applies gravity to free-falling objects. You are given a ground plane for reference, and a sphere that acts like a ball. The ball's height is at z =  0. Determine the ball's velocity after 0.5 seconds if it should be 10 units above the ground plane. The ball should be falling under gravity, and the velocity should be approximately 2 * 9.81 = 19.6 m/s.",

    "answer": "-4.905",
    "expected_behavior": "The LLM should set the position of the ball to 10 units, simulate the fall, and verify the velocity.",
    "reasoning": "Since the ball is falling under gravity, we can use the formula v = gt, where g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2) and t is the time in seconds. After 0.5 seconds, the velocity should be approximately 4.905 m/s.",
